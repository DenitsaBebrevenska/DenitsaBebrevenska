# The newbie coder

## Greetings!

My name is Denitsa and I am a passionate beginner coder.
  
Currently on my journey with C# exploring web, app and even game development. I am very curious where this journey will take me (obviously places)!<br>

## About This Repository

This repository is my playground where I experiment, practice, and document my progress. Feel free to join and develop with me! I am open for suggestions, feedback and collaborations!

## Even more info

I will be focusing on C# for now. I will probably delve into web development along the way, although I am most eager for making games in Unity!
